# Air-Temperature-Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting the monthly mean air temperature using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of historical temperature records from the Changi Climate Station (1982-2020).
Dataset



Source: National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore



Columns:



Month: Date in YYYY-MM format



Mean_temp: Monthly mean temperature in Celsius



Project Goals



Analyze historical temperature trends



Train machine learning models (ARIMA, LSTM)



Predict future monthly mean temperatures



Installation



To run this project, install the required dependencies:



pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels tensorflow



Usage



Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (air_temp_forecast.ipynb) to:



Perform exploratory data analysis.



Train machine learning models.



Forecast future temperatures.



Results



The best-performing model will be used to predict the next few months' mean temperatures, and the forecasted values will be visualized.
